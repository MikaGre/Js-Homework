    <h1>JS Homework 3</h1>
 <div> 
    <p>
        <h2>Pre-requisites:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Use the same test repository that you created before</li>
            <li>Clone that repo to local folder, create new branch and switch to it</li>
            <li>Initialize new node project following the steps I shared in the last class.</li>
        </ol>
      
            <li>initialize new node project</li>
            <li>install mocha and chai as dependencies</li>
            <li>create .gitignore file</li>
            <li>add tests script to your package.json which will run all files with .test.js extension</li>
            <li>create scr and test folders in the root of your project</li>
           
            <p>
                <h2>Homework:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Update your fahrenheitToCelsius converter function that you created previously and add test coverage:
                            - add error handling for all function arguments
                            - make sure your converter returns converted value
                            - put the function under the describe block of your test (similar to how we did it in the class. Also see the example in the github repository that I invited you to)
                            - add as many test cases to your mocha file to make sure that your converter function works as expected
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Do the same to the grade calculation function as you did in exercise #1, but this time put this function in 
                        the external file (in the src folder) and import it in your mocha test file. Please create new test file for 
                        this function, do NOT use the same test file as you used for fahrenheitToCelsius converter function.
                    </li>
                        <br>
                    <li>
                        Write a function that takes a number as an argument (call it maxNum) and logs in the console each number from 1 to maxNum. 
                        For each multiple of 3, add word "Fizz" instead of the number to the log statement.
                        For each multiple of 5, add word "Buzz" instead of the number to the log statement.
                        For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, add "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
                            <a href="./fizzbuzz.html">FizzBuzz</a>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                    I.e. you should see this in the console if you pass 15 as an argument:
                        [
                        "1",
                        "2",
                        "Fizz",
                        "4",
                        "Buzz",
                        "Fizz",
                        "7",
                        "8",
                        "Fizz",
                        "Buzz",
                        "11",
                        "Fizz",
                        "13",
                        "14",
                        "FizzBuzz"
