    <p>  
        Task:
            Having following object:
            let employee = {
            name: 'Mohammad',
            age: 17,
            location: 'New York',
            paycheckHistory: [
                {
                month: 'August',
                amount: 2000,
                },
                {
                month: 'September',
                amount: 1000,
                },
            ],
            };
    </p>

<li>    1. Declare a variable "employeeSummary" and set it to the string value like this:
"Mohammad is 32 years old, lives in New York and his last paycheck was $2000."
You need to dynamically pull name, age and location values from the employee object using template literals.</li>
<li>    2. Log result (employeeSummary) in the console </li>
<li>    3. Now, update employee object by making following changes: 
  - add 1 to age
  - update September's paycheck amount to 3000 </li>
<li>    4. Log the result (employeeSummary) in the console again </li>
<li>    5. Save your code in previously generated HTML file direct message it to me and Gurveer in Slack. </li>
    </p>
